# The Five Zang - Five Systems Model: A Modern Systems Framework for Understanding Human Biology

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Project Overview

This project proposes a novel theoretical framework that bridges the holistic wisdom of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with modern systems biology. It maps the functional systems of the TCM "Five Zang-Organs" to core modern physiological systems, establishing a new "Five Zang-Five Systems" correspondence model.

**Core Idea:** The human body is a dynamic network of five core systems, maintained in balance through the flow of energy and information.

## The Core Model: Your Body's Five Departments

| TCM Zang-Organ | Corresponding Modern System | Core Function (Metaphor) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spleen (ËÑæ)** | **Gut Microbiome Ecosystem** | **Logistics & Energy HQ** |
| **Liver (ËÇù)** | **Neuro-Endocrine Stress Network** | **Emergency & Dispatch Center** |
| **Heart (ÂøÉ)** | **Cardiovascular & CNS Integration** | **Headquarters & Power Pump** |
| **Lung (ËÇ∫)** | **Respiration & Thoracic Dynamics** | **Gas Exchange & Auxiliary Pump** |
| **Kidney (ËÇæ)** | **Bone Marrow & CNS Life Foundation** | **Headquarters Reserve & R&D Center** |

## Key Features

1.  **Systematic:** Moves beyond organ-for-organ correspondence to a dynamic "system-to-system" mapping.
2.  **Scientific:** Provides modern physiological anchors for TCM's functional concepts, making them testable.
3.  **Practical:** Offers a clear roadmap for integrative medicine, clinical practice, and personal health management.
4.  **Predictive:** Generates novel, testable scientific hypotheses about system interactions and drug mechanisms.

## Scientific Predictions & Hypotheses

This model is not just descriptive; it is predictive. It generates falsifiable hypotheses at the intersection of TCM and modern science, such as:

*   **The Mood-Gut Connection:** Herbal formulas that "soothe the Liver" (e.g., *Xiaoyao San*) will **specifically reverse stress-induced gut dysbiosis**, increasing the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and reducing stress-associated species.
*   **The Breath-Blood Link:** The deep, rhythmic mechanics of diaphragmatic breathing act as a **physiological signal that directly enhances bone marrow function** for hematopoiesis and immune cell generation.
*   **The Heart-Brain-Regen Axis:** The heart secretes specific **"cardio-derived neurotrophic factors"** that directly promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the brain, forming a concrete basis for the TCM concept of "Heart-Kidney interaction."

*(For a complete list of predictions and detailed hypotheses, please see the main documentation in Chinese.)*

## Get Started

1.  **For Beginners:** Start with the core concepts to understand the five systems.
2.  **Explore Applications:** See how the model applies to diagnostics, herbal strategy, and lifestyle.
3.  **Join the Discussion:** We welcome discussions, issues, and contributions to help evolve this model.
